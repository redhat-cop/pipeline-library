# OpenShift Pipeline Library

## What This Repo Is

This is a shared library of Jenkins Pipeline functionality we've developed and use frequently within the CoP. This repo can be imported into a jenkins server (following [this doc](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#using-libraries)) and used to add functionality to Pipeline scripts.

Included in this library:

* [org.redhatcop.util.Notifications](./src/org/redhatcop/util/Notifications.txt) - A build status notification system for chat-ops
