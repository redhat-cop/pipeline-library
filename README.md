# What This Repo Is

A repository of application centric [Jenkins pipeline files](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) that can be referenced or reused for appropriate applications.
We'll organize pipelines by the build tool of application. 

It will be common to require custom Jenkins slaves, and if so, a README should link to a slave definition.

# What This Repo Is NOT 

* steps / functions / library code 
* end to end examples/demos/quickstarts. 
* infrastructure / platform centric Jenkinsfile
