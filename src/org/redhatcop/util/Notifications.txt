# Notifications library

Sends notifications on build status to rocketChat.

This requires you to set up an [Incoming Webhook](https://rocket.chat/docs/administrator-guides/integrations/) in RocketChat.

Sample usage:

```
@Library('cop-library') _

def rocketchat_url = 'https://rocket.example.com/hooks/[integration_id]/[integration_secret]'
def n = new org.redhatcop.util.notifications()

n.notifyBuild('STARTED', rocketchat_url)
```
