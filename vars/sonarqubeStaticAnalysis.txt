# sonarqubeStaticAnalysis

## Summary

This function will:
- validate that a build server webhook has been configured in SonarQube
- run the sonar:sonar maven goal for the configured pom file
- wait for the quality gate status to be OK.

The pipeline will be stopped if the webhook has not been configured or the quality gate fails. Be advised that the
SonarQube deployment @ https://github.com/redhat-cop/containers-quickstarts/tree/master/sonarqube
will create this webhook for you.

## Usage

### Requirements

Requires Jenkins agent with:
- OC
- Maven
- SonarQube server and Jenkins plugin

### Parameters

The method supports the following parameters:
```java
// sonarqubeStaticAnalysis.groovy#L4-L7

//Optional
String pomFile = "pom.xml"
String buildServerWebHookName = "jenkins"
String curlOptions = ""
```

### Example

```java
// ../test/Jenkinsfile-sonarqubeStaticAnalysis#L84-L92

stage("TEST: Can run sonarqube static analysis") {
    sh "git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/pipeline-library.git"

    dir ("pipeline-library") {
        sonarqubeStaticAnalysis([
            curlOptions: "--insecure"
        ])
    }
}
```

### Local vs Remote cluster support

As the underlying technology used is the [openshift-client-plugin](https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-client-plugin),
the ability to connect to a the local cluster, a cluster via URL/Token or using
[Jenkins configuration](https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-client-plugin#configuring-an-openshift-cluster) is as easy
as setting the clusterAPI and clusterToken parameters.
